## `sock_connect()`

Initiate a connection on a socket to the specified address.

### Description

The `sock_connect()` function is used to initiate a connection on a socket to the specified address. It is similar to the `connect` function in POSIX.

Once the connection is initiated, the socket handle can be polled to wait for data to arrive or for the socket status to change, which can be queried using the `sock_status()` function.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn sock_connect<M: MemorySize>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    sock: WasiFd,
    addr: WasmPtr<__wasi_addr_port_t, M>,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the socket to connect.
- `addr`: The address of the socket to connect to.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the outcome of the operation. If the operation is successful, `Errno::Success` is returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_connect()` function initiates a connection on a socket to the specified address.
- The function blocks until the connection is established or an error occurs.
- The address of the remote socket is specified by `addr`.
- Once the connection is established, the socket handle can be polled to wait for data to arrive or for the socket status to change.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_connect()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
