## `thread_local_set()`

Sets the value of a thread local variable.

### Description

The `thread_local_set()` function sets the value of a thread local variable associated with the current thread within the WASI environment. Thread local variables are variables that are local to each thread and have their own separate instances in each thread's memory. This function allows you to associate a value with a specific thread local variable key.

This function is analogous to the POSIX `pthread_setspecific()` function, which sets the value of a thread-specific data key for the current thread.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn thread_local_set(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    key: TlKey,
    val: TlVal,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `key`: The thread key that the thread local variable is associated with.
- `val`: The value to be set for the thread local variable.

### Return Value

The function returns `Errno::Success` if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value indicating the reason for the failure.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `trace` level logging.

### Note

- The `thread_local_set()` function sets the value of a thread local variable associated with the current thread within the WASI environment.
- Thread local variables are variables that are local to each thread and have their own separate instances in each thread's memory.
- This function allows you to associate a value with a specific thread local variable key.
- The value set using `thread_local_set()` can later be retrieved using the `thread_local_get()` function.
- The `thread_local_set()` function takes the thread key and the value as input.
- It associates the value with the specified thread local variable key for the current thread.
- Each thread has its own separate instance of the thread local variable, and the value can be accessed and modified independently by each thread.
- Proper management of thread local variables is essential to ensure thread-safety and prevent data races in multi-threaded applications.
- The `thread_local_set()` function is analogous to the POSIX `pthread_setspecific()` function, which sets the value of a thread-specific data key for the current thread.
- Thread local variables are commonly used in multi-threaded applications to store thread-specific data and provide thread-local storage for efficient and thread-safe operations.
- When using thread local variables, it is important to ensure that proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to avoid data races and ensure consistent behavior across threads.
- The `thread_local_set()` function provides a way to set the value of thread local variables in the WASI environment, enabling thread-specific data storage and facilitating thread-safe operations.
