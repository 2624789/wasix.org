## `path_rename()`

Rename a file or directory.

### Description

The `path_rename()` function renames a file or directory specified by the given path. It requires the `PATH_RENAME_SOURCE` right on the source directory and the `PATH_RENAME_TARGET` right on the target directory.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `rename()` function. It renames a file or directory with the specified source and target paths. The `rename()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn path_rename<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    old_fd: WasiFd,
    old_path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    old_path_len: M::Offset,
    new_fd: WasiFd,
    new_path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    new_path_len: M::Offset,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `old_fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory for the source path.
- `old_path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the source path of the file or directory to be renamed.
- `old_path_len`: The length of the `old_path` string.
- `new_fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory for the target path.
- `new_path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the target path with the new name for the file or directory.
- `new_path_len`: The length of the `new_path` string.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%old_fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory for the source path.
- `%new_fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory for the target path.
- `old_path`: The source path string.
- `new_path`: The target path string.

### Note

The `path_rename()` function renames a file or directory specified by the given source path to the target path. It checks the necessary rights on both the source and target directories. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `rename()` function.
