## `path_unlink_file()`

Unlink a file, deleting it if the number of hardlinks is 1.

### Description

The `path_unlink_file()` function unlinks a file at the specified path. If the file has only one hardlink (i.e., its link count is 1), it will be deleted from the file system. It requires the `PATH_UNLINK_FILE` right on the base file descriptor.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `unlink()` function. It removes the specified file from the file system. If the file has no other hardlinks, it is completely deleted. The `unlink()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn path_unlink_file<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    fd: WasiFd,
    path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    path_len: M::Offset,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory from which the path is understood.
- `path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path of the file to be unlinked.
- `path_len`: The length of the `path` string.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory.
- `path`: The path string.

### Note

The `path_unlink_file()` function unlinks a file at the specified path, deleting it if the number of hardlinks is 1. It checks the necessary rights on the base file descriptor. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `unlink()` function.
