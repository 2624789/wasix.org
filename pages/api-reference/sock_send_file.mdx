## `sock_send_file()`

Sends the entire contents of a file down a socket.

### Description

The `sock_send_file()` function is used to send the entire contents of a file down a socket. It reads the data from the file and transmits it over the socket. The function returns the number of bytes transmitted.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn sock_send_file<M: MemorySize>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    sock: WasiFd,
    in_fd: WasiFd,
    offset: Filesize,
    mut count: Filesize,
    ret_sent: WasmPtr<Filesize, M>,
) -> Result<Errno, WasiError>
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the socket to send on.
- `in_fd`: The file descriptor of the open file that has the data to be transmitted.
- `offset`: The offset into the file to start reading at.
- `count`: The number of bytes to be sent.
- `ret_sent`: A pointer to store the number of bytes transmitted.

### Return Value

The function returns a `Result` containing an `Errno` value. If the operation is successful, `Errno::Success` is returned. Otherwise, an appropriate `Errno` value indicating the error is returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_send_file()` function sends the entire contents of a file down a socket.
- It starts reading from the specified offset within the file.
- The `count` parameter specifies the number of bytes to be sent. It is decremented as data is transmitted.
- The function enters a loop to process the data in chunks. Each chunk is read from the file and sent over the socket.
- The function supports reading data from different types of files, including regular files, standard input, and pipes.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_send_file()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
