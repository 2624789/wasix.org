## `thread_local_destroy()`

Destroys a thread local variable.

### Description

The `thread_local_destroy()` function destroys a thread local variable within the WASI environment. Thread local variables are variables that are local to each thread and have their own separate instances in each thread's memory. When a thread local variable goes out of scope, its destructor function is invoked, if available, to perform any necessary cleanup operations.

This function is analogous to the POSIX `pthread_key_delete()` function, which deletes a thread-specific data key that was previously created.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn thread_local_destroy(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    key: TlKey,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `key`: The thread key that was previously created for the thread local variable.

### Return Value

The function returns `Errno::Success` if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value indicating the reason for the failure.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `trace` level logging.

### Note

- The `thread_local_destroy()` function destroys a thread local variable within the WASI environment.
- Thread local variables are variables that are local to each thread and have their own separate instances in each thread's memory.
- When a thread local variable goes out of scope, its destructor function is invoked, if available, to perform any necessary cleanup operations.
- The `thread_local_destroy()` function takes the thread key as input, which identifies the thread local variable to be destroyed.
- After the thread local variable is destroyed, any associated memory or resources are released, and the variable is no longer accessible.
- If a destructor function is provided for the thread local variable, it is invoked during the destruction process to perform custom cleanup operations.
- The `thread_local_destroy()` function is analogous to the POSIX `pthread_key_delete()` function, which deletes a thread-specific data key that was previously created.
- Proper management of thread local variables is essential to ensure correct memory deallocation and resource cleanup.
- Thread local variables are commonly used in multi-threaded applications to store thread-specific data and facilitate thread-safe operations.
- When using thread local variables, it is important to ensure that resources associated with the variable are properly released to avoid memory leaks or resource leaks.
- The `thread_local_destroy()` function provides a way to destroy thread local variables in the WASI environment, enabling proper cleanup and deallocation of thread-specific data.
