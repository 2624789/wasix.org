## `sock_recv()`

Receive a message from a socket.

### Description

The `sock_recv()` function is used to receive a message from a socket. It is similar to the `recv` function in POSIX, but it also supports reading the data into multiple buffers in the manner of `readv`.

The function receives data from the socket and stores it in the provided scatter/gather vectors. The number of bytes stored in `ri_data` and the message flags are returned.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn sock_recv<M: MemorySize>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    sock: WasiFd,
    ri_data: WasmPtr<__wasi_iovec_t<M>, M>,
    ri_data_len: M::Offset,
    ri_flags: RiFlags,
    ro_data_len: WasmPtr<M::Offset, M>,
    ro_flags: WasmPtr<RoFlags, M>,
) -> Result<Errno, WasiError>
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the socket to receive from.
- `ri_data`: A list of scatter/gather vectors to which the received data will be stored.
- `ri_data_len`: The length of the scatter/gather vector list.
- `ri_flags`: Message flags.
- `ro_data_len`: A pointer to store the number of bytes read.
- `ro_flags`: A pointer to store the message flags.

### Return Value

The function returns a `Result` containing an `Errno` value. If the operation is successful, `Errno::Success` is returned. Otherwise, an appropriate `Errno` value indicating the error is returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_recv()` function receives a message from a socket and stores it in the provided scatter/gather vectors.
- The function supports reading the data into multiple buffers.
- The `ri_data` parameter represents a list of scatter/gather vectors, where each vector contains a buffer and its length.
- The `ri_data_len` parameter specifies the length of the scatter/gather vector list.
- The received data is stored in the buffers specified by the scatter/gather vectors.
- The number of bytes read from the socket is stored in `ro_data_len`.
- The message flags are stored in `ro_flags`.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_recv()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
