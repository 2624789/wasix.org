## `fd_renumber()`

Atomically copy a file descriptor.

### Description

The `fd_renumber()` function atomically copies a file descriptor from one location to another. It ensures that the copying operation is performed atomically and returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn fd_renumber(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    from: WasiFd,
    to: WasiFd,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `from`: The file descriptor to copy.
- `to`: The location to copy the file descriptor to.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%from`: The file descriptor being copied.
- `%to`: The location to which the file descriptor is being copied.

### Note

The `fd_renumber()` function atomically copies a file descriptor from one location to another. It takes the source file descriptor `from` and the destination file descriptor `to`. If the `from` and `to` file descriptors are the same, the function returns `Errno::Success` without performing any copying operation.

The function retrieves the file descriptor map from the WASI environment and attempts to find the file descriptor entry corresponding to `from`. If the entry is found, a new file descriptor entry is created with the same properties as the original entry, except for the file descriptor number, which is set to `to`. The new entry is then inserted into the file descriptor map with the `to` file descriptor number.

The function returns an `Errno` value to indicate the success or failure of the operation. If the file descriptor is successfully copied, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.
