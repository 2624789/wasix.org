## `path_filestat_get()`

Access metadata about a file or directory.

### Description

The `path_filestat_get()` function allows accessing metadata (file statistics) for a file or directory specified by a path relative to the given directory. It retrieves information such as the size, timestamps, and file type.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `stat()` or `lstat()` functions, depending on whether symbolic links should be followed or not. These functions retrieve information about a file or symbolic link and store it in a `struct stat` object.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn path_filestat_get<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    fd: WasiFd,
    flags: LookupFlags,
    path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    path_len: M::Offset,
    buf: WasmPtr<Filestat, M>,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory that the `path` is relative to.
- `flags`: Flags to control how the `path` is understood.
- `path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the file path.
- `path_len`: The length of the `path` string.
- `buf`: A wasm pointer to a `Filestat` object where the metadata will be stored.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with trace-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory.
- `path`: The path string.

### Note

The `path_filestat_get()` function allows accessing metadata (file statistics) for a file or directory specified by a path relative to the given directory. It checks if the specified directory has the necessary rights and retrieves the file statistics accordingly. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `stat()` or `lstat()` functions.
