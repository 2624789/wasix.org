## `clock_time_get()`

Get the time of the specified clock.

### Description

The `clock_time_get()` function is used to retrieve the time of the specified clock. It returns the value of the clock in nanoseconds.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn clock_time_get<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    clock_id: Snapshot0Clockid,
    precision: Timestamp,
    time: WasmPtr<Timestamp, M>,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `clock_id`: The ID of the clock to query.
- `precision`: The maximum amount of error the reading may have.
- `time`: A WebAssembly pointer to a memory location where the value of the clock will be written.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with trace-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `?clock_id`: The ID of the clock being queried.
- `%precision`: The maximum amount of error for the reading.

### Note

The `clock_time_get()` function retrieves the time of the specified clock. The time value is returned in nanoseconds and is written to the specified memory location.
