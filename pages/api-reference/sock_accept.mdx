## `sock_accept()`

Accept a new incoming connection.

### Description

The `sock_accept()` function is used to accept a new incoming connection on a listening socket. It is similar to the `accept` function in POSIX.

When a connection is accepted, a new socket is created and returned. This new socket represents the communication channel with the client.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn sock_accept<M: MemorySize>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    sock: WasiFd,
    mut fd_flags: Fdflags,
    ro_fd: WasmPtr<WasiFd, M>,
    ro_addr: WasmPtr<__wasi_addr_port_t, M>,
) -> Result<Errno, WasiError>
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the listening socket on which to accept a connection.
- `fd_flags`: The desired values of the file descriptor flags for the new socket.
- `ro_fd`: A WebAssembly pointer where the file descriptor of the new socket will be written.
- `ro_addr`: A WebAssembly pointer where the address of the remote client will be written.

### Return Value

The function returns a `Result` containing the outcome of the operation. If the operation is successful, `Ok(Errno::Success)` is returned, and the file descriptor of the new socket is written to the memory location pointed to by `ro_fd`. The address of the remote client is written to the memory location pointed to by `ro_addr`.

### Notes

- The `sock_accept()` function accepts a new incoming connection on a listening socket.
- The function blocks until a connection request is received.
- Upon successful acceptance of a connection, a new socket is created to handle communication with the client.
- The file descriptor flags specified by `fd_flags` control the behavior of the new socket.
- The address of the remote client, including the IP address and port number, is written to the memory location pointed to by `ro_addr`.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_accept()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
