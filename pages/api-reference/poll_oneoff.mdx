## `poll_oneoff()`

Concurrently poll for a set of events.

### Description

The `poll_oneoff()` function allows concurrent polling for a set of events. It takes an array of event subscriptions and returns the events that have occurred since the last poll. It is instrumented with `trace` level logging for debugging purposes.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `poll()` function. It allows monitoring multiple file descriptors for various types of events, such as read or write readiness, error conditions, or hang-up events. The `poll()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn poll_oneoff<M: MemorySize + 'static>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    in_: WasmPtr<Subscription, M>,
    out_: WasmPtr<Event, M>,
    nsubscriptions: M::Offset,
    nevents: WasmPtr<M::Offset, M>,
) -> Result<Errno, WasiError>
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `in_`: A wasm pointer to an array of `__wasi_subscription_t` structures representing the events to subscribe to.
- `out_`: A wasm pointer to an array of `__wasi_event_t` structures where the occurred events will be stored.
- `nsubscriptions`: The number of subscriptions and the number of events.
- `nevents`: A wasm pointer to a `u32` variable that will store the number of events seen.

### Return Value

The function returns a `Result` indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Ok(Errno::Success)`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with `trace` level logging. It includes the following fields for debugging purposes:

- `timeout_ms`: The timeout value in milliseconds.
- `fd_guards`: The file descriptor guards.
- `seen`: The number of events seen.

### Note

The `poll_oneoff()` function enables concurrent polling for a set of events. It internally uses the `poll_oneoff_internal()` function to perform the actual polling operation.

The function first processes any pending signals and exits if necessary. It then increments the poll seed to ensure different event ordering in subsequent calls.

Next, it retrieves the event subscriptions from the input array and creates a list of subscription objects. Each subscription object represents an event subscription.

The function clears the number of events to prepare for the upcoming polling.
