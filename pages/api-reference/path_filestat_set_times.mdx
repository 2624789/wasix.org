## `path_filestat_set_times()`

Update time metadata on a file or directory.

### Description

The `path_filestat_set_times()` function allows updating the time metadata (last accessed time and last modified time) for a file or directory specified by a path relative to the given directory.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `utimensat()` function. It updates the timestamps (access time and modification time) of a file or directory with nanosecond precision.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn path_filestat_set_times<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    fd: WasiFd,
    flags: LookupFlags,
    path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    path_len: M::Offset,
    st_atim: Timestamp,
    st_mtim: Timestamp,
    fst_flags: Fstflags,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory that the `path` is relative to.
- `flags`: Flags to control how the `path` is understood.
- `path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the file path.
- `path_len`: The length of the `path` string.
- `st_atim`: The timestamp that the last accessed time attribute is set to.
- `st_mtim`: The timestamp that the last modified time attribute is set to.
- `fst_flags`: A bitmask controlling which attributes are set.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory.
- `path`: The path string.
- `%st_atim`: The last accessed time attribute value.
- `%st_mtim`: The last modified time attribute value.

### Note

The `path_filestat_set_times()` function allows updating the time metadata (last accessed time and last modified time) for a file or directory specified by a path relative to the given directory. It checks if the specified directory has the necessary rights and updates the timestamps accordingly. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `utimensat()` function.
