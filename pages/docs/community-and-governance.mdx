# Community and Governance

We want to welcome as many developers and companies joining and participating in WASIX.
This is a project that aims to be governed by many entities, not just one.

**`Wazero`**, **`Zig`**, and **`AssemblyScript`** could be great additions to the governance team, but any others will be more than welcome.
As long as you want to move WASIX forward you will be welcome to chime in and participate in its progress.

The aim of WASIX is to allow any kind of app to be compileable to Wasm: supporting POSIX apps seems like the best way to accomplish this without recreating the world.

Would you like to participate in the future of WASIX?

You can join in the following ways:

- [WASIX Discord](https://discord.gg/qBTfsNP7N8)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wasix-org/discussions/1) (Discussions for official meetings will be here)
