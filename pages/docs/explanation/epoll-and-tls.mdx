# WASIX: Epoll and TLS

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  As of [wasmer 4.1](https://wasmer.io/posts/wasmer-4.1), wasmer implements
  `epoll` for polling on file descriptors. This syscall was added to improve
  performance in wasix. However, `poll_oneoff` is still supported.
</Callout>

The release of wasmer 4.1 introduced `epoll` support for wasix. Works for both features, `epoll` and **TLS** support started in April 2023.
Both features were very important for wasix, as they open up gates for new use cases and improve performance in aspects such as networking, file system access, cryptography, etc.

## Epoll

`epoll` is a variant of `poll` available in the Linux kernel, designed to be more efficient when dealing with large numbers of file descriptors.
Unlike `poll`, which scans through all file descriptors each time it is called, epoll uses an event-driven approach.
It maintains a **watch list** of file descriptors, and only those that have changed status since the last call will be returned to the user.

You can learn more about `epoll`, `poll` and `select` in this [article](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/) by Julia Evans and from a github repository dedicated to learning I/O polling [here](https://github.com/pniewiejski/learn-io-polling).

### Implmentation history

Works on `epoll` for WASIX started in April 2023, in the PR [#3830](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/pull/3830).

This PR was just a proof of concept, for asynchronous I/O multiplexing using `epoll` in WASIX. This POC would have given huge performance benefits when used correctly by a WASIX program.

This PR served as a foundation for [#4050](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/pull/4050) which was the implementation of **asynchronous I/O** using `epoll` in WASIX.

(Can you elaborate more ?) - TODO @sharrattj ?

### What this means for WASIX ?

Before wasmer 4.1, wasmer runtime used the `poll_oneoff` syscall for non-blocking operations such as networking, file system access, etc. This meant that we had to fork mio to use the `poll_oneoff` syscall but found limitations with inconsistencies on how POSIX implements poll and how WASI specified `poll_oneoff`.
By implementing the much more scalable epoll syscall this allows for a consistent implementation that matches closer to POSIX without hurting WASI backwards compatibility which WASIX is committed to retain.

This means that:

- `epoll` scales much better when running lots of file descriptors. E.g. a http server with hundreds of connections.
- The I/O lattency is more deterministic and predictable when under heavy load.
- CPU usage is more efficient than `poll_oneoff`
- The new epoll calls are much more stable as the code paths are cleaner under the hood as they are much closer to how Linux works

To sum up, the bread and butter of an HTTP Server is now more **stable** and **scalable**.

### What this means for libraries ?

`tokio` the most popular asynchronous runtime for Rust. It is used by many libraries such as `hyper`, `actix-web`, `tide`, `sqlx`, `async-std`, etc.
It's multiplexed I/O is implemented using `mio` which is a library that provides a cross-platform interface for multiplexed I/O.
`mio` uses `epoll` and `kqueue` in its native implementaiton but implements [`poll_oneoff`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/blob/master/src/sys/wasi/mod.rs) for WASI.

The official [notes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/blob/2123bedbed00e24dccc036a0e1799e9e1d7dba1c/src/sys/wasi/mod.rs#L1-L14) from `mio`'s WASI implementation too state that:

> The current implementation is somewhat limited. The `Waker` is not implemented, as at the time of writing there is no way to support to wake-up a thread from calling `poll_oneoff`.
> Furthermore the (re/de)register functions also don't work while concurrently polling as both registering and polling requires a lock on the `subscriptions`.
> Finally `Selector::try_clone`, required by `Registry::try_clone`, doesn't work. However this could be implemented by use of an `Arc`.
> In summary, **this only (barely) works using a single thread.**

**SINGLE THREADED!! ???** Would you settle for single threaded when you can have the full power of tokio in WASIX ! That's what we thought too.

## TLS

Now, comming to TLS. One of the most rewqested feature. (pun intended)

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end encryption and authentication over the internet.
It is required by many applications such as HTTPS, SMTPS, SFTP, etc.

Our primary focus for TLS was to enable HTTPS clients support for WASIX. This would allow WASIX to be used for outbound HTTPS requests, external API calls, etc.

### Implementation history

Okay, this story is kind of a roller coaster ride. So, buckle up.

TLS works by using a **handshake** protocol to establish a secure connection between two parties. This handshake protocol is implemented by any cryptographic library such as OpenSSL, LibreSSL, BoringSSL, etc.
For WASI this is under a proposal called [WASI Crypto](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-crypto). This proposal is lead by [Frank Denis](https://github.com/jedisct1) and [Daiki Ueno](https://github.com/ueno).

So there were two paths to implement TLS in WASIX:

1. Use WASI Crypto to implement TLS in WASIX.
2. Try to compile ring for WASIX.

Like any sane person, we should have waited for WASI Crypto to be implemented or just tried the basic implementation of [WASI crypto](https://github.com/wasm-crypto/wasi-crypto-host-functions) in WASIX.
But this would have meant that all the libraries that didn't have this implementation such as rustls would not work in WASIX.

But, one thing I learnt at Wasmer is you don't compromise with the developer experience and implement the future NOW.
So I went down the rabbit hole of trying to compile ring for WASIX.

<Callout type="default" emoji="🥲">
  **This didn't come in easy.**
</Callout>

The challenge was ring implements a lot of cryptographic algorithms and implements them using Assembly language which are precompiled for every target
such as Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc. but for targets that don't have a precompiled assembly language implementation, ring uses a C implementation.

Boom, this is what we needed. We just needed to compile the C implementation of ring for WASIX. But, this was not as easy as it sounds.

I started exploring the ring codebase and found two potential PRs to test out:

- [#1499](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/1499)
- [#1568](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/1568)

Sadly none of them compiled as **#1499** was not well updated and **#1568** resulted in an error of bn_mul_mont. Which is actually now fixed in the latest ring available on master.

This too was back in April. I then moved on but interestingly one day I got a notification from [Frank Denis](https://github.com/jedisct1) that he compiled ring for WASI and WASIX in his [ring-wasi](https://github.com/jedisct1/ring-wasi) repository.
This was really exciting and I started testing it out. I quickly forked the repo and started testing it out in WASIX. Sadly, it didn't work but it got us to a 99% working implementation.

So, a few sleepless nights, lot's of energy drink and a dangling around trying to compile every possible `C` file in ring and adding a `bn_mul_mont` fallback. I finally got it to work.
It was like first time looking at a rainbow 🌈.

Now our implementation of ring which works for WASI/WASIX lives [here](https://github.com/wasix-org/ring).

Compiling ring was the first step. The team quickly got to work to implement all other required libraries:

- [rustls](https://github.com/wasix-org/rustls)
- [tokio-rustls](https://github.com/wasix-org/tokio-rustls)
- [hyper](https://github.com/wasix-org/hyper)
- [hyper-rustls](https://github.com/wasix-org/hyper-rustls)
- [reqwest](https://github.com/wasix-org/reqwest)
- [webpki-roots](https://github.com/wasix-org/webpki-roots)
- [webpki](https://github.com/wasix-org/webpki)
- [sct](https://github.com/wasix-org/sct)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  WASI/WASIX can't use the CA certificates available on a host machine so it
  need `webpki-roots` to be able to verify the certificates.
</Callout>

### What this means for WASIX ?

This means that WASIX can now be used for outbound HTTPS requests, external API calls, etc. This is a huge step for WASIX as it opens up a lot of use cases for WASIX.

1. **Secure Access to APIs**: Many modern APIs require a client to communicate over HTTPS. With TLS support, WASIX applications can securely access these APIs directly.
2. **Secure Database Connections**: WASIX applications can use TLS to connect securely to databases that support encrypted connections. This ensures that sensitive data is protected during transit.
3. **Secure Third-Party Integrations**: If your WASIX applications need to interact with third-party services (like payment gateways, OAuth providers, etc.), TLS client support allows these interactions to occur securely.
4. **Ingress and Egress Data Security**: Implementing TLS clients ensures that both incoming and outgoing data from the application is secure, a significant benefit in complex systems where both ingress and egress points need to be equally secure.
5. **CDN and Edge Computing**: TLS client support can ensure secure communication with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing resources, protecting data integrity and confidentiality while improving content delivery speed.
6. **Confidential Computing**: With TLS client support, applications can securely retrieve and use confidential data, cryptographic keys, or certificates from remote secure servers or key management systems.
7. **IoT Applications**: In IoT applications, devices often need to communicate with a central server. TLS client support can be used to ensure these communications are secure.

## Conclusion

The power of `epoll` and `TLS` makes WASIX more stable, secure and scalable than ever.

This was a huge step for WASIX and we are really excited to see what the community builds with this.
We are also working on a few examples to showcase the power of WASIX.
You can try out our starter tutorial for outbound proxies [here](/todo/). More examples will follow suit.

At the end, I would like to thank Frank Denis on the behalf of whole Wasmer Team for his work on the ring-wasi implementation and all of the wasmer team for their support and guidance and ofcourse their work on Wasmer 4.1.
