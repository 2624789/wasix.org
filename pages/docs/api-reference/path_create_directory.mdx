## `path_create_directory()`

Create a directory at a path.

### Description

The `path_create_directory()` function creates a new directory at the specified path relative to the given directory. It requires the `PATH_CREATE_DIRECTORY` right to be set on the directory where the new directory will be created.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `mkdir()` function. It creates a new directory with the given name and the specified permission mode. The `mkdir()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `mkdirat` in POSIX.
  ;;; Create a directory.
  (@interface func (export "path_create_directory")
    (param $fd $fd)
    ;;; The path at which to create the directory.
    (param $path string)
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory that the path is relative to.
- `path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path data.
- `path_len`: The length of the `path` string.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with trace-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory.
- `path`: The path string.

### Note

The `path_create_directory()` function creates a new directory at the specified path relative to the given directory. It checks if the specified directory has the necessary rights and creates the directory accordingly. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `mkdir()` function.
