## `proc_exec()`

Replaces the current process with a new process.

### Description

The `proc_exec()` function is used to replace the current process with a new process. It takes the name of the process to be spawned and a list of arguments as input. The new process will be executed with the specified name and arguments.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `execve()` function. It replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the given executable file. The `execve()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; If the named process does not exist then the process will fail and terminate
  ;;;
  ;;; and uninitialized) data segments
  ;;; with  a  new  program, with newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized
  ;;; program that is currently being run by the calling process to  be  replaced
  ;;; execve()  executes  the  program  referred to by pathname.  This causes the
  (@interface func (export "proc_exec")
    ;;; Name of the process to be spawned
    (param $name string)
    ;;; List of the arguments to pass the process
    ;;; (entries are separated by line feeds)
    (param $args string)
    ;;; This function never returns
    (@witx noreturn)
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `name`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string representing the name of the process to be spawned.
- `name_len`: The length of the `name` string.
- `args`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string representing the arguments to pass to the process. Multiple arguments are separated by line feeds.
- `args_len`: The length of the `args` string.

### Return Value

The function returns `Ok(())` if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `WasiError` value.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `debug` level logging. It includes the following fields for debugging purposes:

- `name`: The name of the process to be spawned.
- `args_len`: The length of the arguments string.

### Notes

- The `proc_exec()` function replaces the current process with a new process.
- It takes the name and arguments of the new process as input.
- On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `execve()` function, which replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by the given executable file.
- Executing a new process allows for dynamic program execution, enabling the running program to be replaced with a different program specified by the name and arguments.
- The function converts relative paths into absolute paths before executing the new process.
- The process execution involves preparing the environment, creating a new process, and switching the execution to the new process.
- If the function is called within a `vfork` context, a subprocess is spawned with the forked `WasiEnv`, and a longjmp is performed back to the `vfork` point.
- The `proc_exec()` function can be used to invoke calls on the new process by using the returned bus process ID.
