## `proc_raise()`

Send a signal to the process of the calling thread.

### Description

The `proc_raise()` function sends a signal to the process of the calling thread. It takes a `Signal` as input, which represents the signal to be raised for the process.

This function is similar to the `raise` function in POSIX, which sends a signal to the current process or a specific process.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `raise` in POSIX.
  ;;; Send a signal to the process of the calling thread.
  (@interface func (export "proc_raise")
    ;;; The signal condition to trigger.
    (param $sig $signal)
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sig`: The signal to be raised for the process.

### Return Value

The function returns `Ok(Errno::Success)` if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `WasiError` value.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `debug` level logging. It includes the following field for debugging purposes:

- `sig`: The signal to be raised.

### Notes

- The `proc_raise()` function sends a signal to the process of the calling thread.
- It uses the `signal_process()` method of the current process to send the signal.
- This function is similar to the `raise` function in POSIX, which sends a signal to the current process or a specific process.
- After sending the signal, the function calls `WasiEnv::process_signals_and_exit()` to process any pending signals and handle process termination if necessary.
