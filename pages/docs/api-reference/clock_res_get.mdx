## `clock_res_get()`

Get the resolution of the specified clock.

### Description

The `clock_res_get()` function is used to retrieve the resolution of the specified clock. It returns the resolution of the clock in nanoseconds.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `clock_getres` in POSIX.
  ;;; return `errno::inval`.
  ;;; Implementations are required to provide a non-zero value for supported clocks. For unsupported clocks,
  ;;; Return the resolution of a clock.
  (@interface func (export "clock_res_get")
    ;;; The clock for which to return the resolution.
    (param $id $clockid)
    ;;; The resolution of the clock, or an error if one happened.
    (result $error (expected $timestamp (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `clock_id`: The ID of the clock to get the resolution of.
- `resolution`: A WebAssembly pointer to a memory location where the resolution of the clock will be written.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with trace-level logging.

### Note

The `clock_res_get()` function retrieves the resolution of the specified clock. The resolution is returned in nanoseconds and is written to the specified memory location.
