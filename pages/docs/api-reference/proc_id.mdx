## `proc_id()`

Returns the handle of the current process.

### Description

The `proc_id()` function is used to retrieve the handle of the current process. It returns the process identifier (PID) of the calling process.

In POSIX systems, a process ID is a unique identifier assigned to each running process. The PID is used by the operating system to track and manage processes.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn proc_id<M: MemorySize>(ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>, ret_pid: WasmPtr<Pid, M>) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: The function environment.
- `ret_pid`: Pointer to store the returned process ID.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the result of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `debug` level logging. It includes the following field for debugging purposes:

- `pid`: The process ID of the current process.

### Note

- The `proc_id()` function is used to retrieve the handle of the current process.
- It accesses the process identifier (PID) of the calling process using the `pid()` method of the current process.
- The function stores the process ID in the specified `ret_pid` pointer.
- The process ID is a unique identifier assigned to each running process.
- The function does not raise any errors and always returns `Errno::Success`.
