## `path_remove_directory()`

Remove a directory.

### Description

The `path_remove_directory()` function removes a directory specified by the given path. It requires the `PATH_REMOVE_DIRECTORY` right to be set on the directory.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `rmdir()` function. It removes an empty directory with the specified path. The `rmdir()` function is part of the POSIX standard and is widely supported across different platforms.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn path_remove_directory<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    fd: WasiFd,
    path: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    path_len: M::Offset,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory from which the path is resolved.
- `path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path of the directory to remove.
- `path_len`: The length of the `path` string.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%fd`: The file descriptor representing the base directory.
- `path`: The path string.

### Note

The `path_remove_directory()` function removes a directory specified by the given path. It checks if the directory is empty and has the necessary rights to be removed. On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `rmdir()` function.
