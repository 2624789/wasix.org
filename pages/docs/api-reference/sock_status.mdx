## `sock_status()`

Returns the current status of a socket.

### Description

The `sock_status()` function retrieves the current status of a socket identified by the file descriptor `sock` and stores the status in the `ret_status` memory location.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn sock_status<M: MemorySize>(
    mut ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    sock: WasiFd,
    ret_status: WasmPtr<Sockstatus, M>,
) -> Errno
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the socket whose status will be retrieved.
- `ret_status`: A WebAssembly pointer to a memory location where the status of the socket will be stored.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the outcome of the operation. If the operation is successful, `Errno::Success` is returned. If an error occurs, an appropriate `Errno` value is returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_status()` function retrieves the current status of the socket identified by the file descriptor `sock`.
- The status of the socket is stored in the `ret_status` memory location, which should be a `WasmPtr<Sockstatus>` pointing to a writable memory region.
- The possible socket status values are:
  - `Opening`: The socket is in the process of opening.
  - `Opened`: The socket has been successfully opened.
  - `Closed`: The socket has been closed.
  - `Failed`: An error occurred while opening or using the socket.
- The behavior and limitations of the `sock_status()` function may vary depending on the specific runtime environment and underlying networking implementation. It is important to consult the documentation or specifications of the specific environment to understand its behavior in that context.
