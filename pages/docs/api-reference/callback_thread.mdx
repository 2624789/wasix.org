## `callback_thread()`

Sets the callback to invoke upon spawning of new threads.

### Description

The `callback_thread()` function sets the callback function that will be invoked when new threads are spawned. It allows applications to define a custom function to handle thread spawning events and perform specific actions in response.

This function takes the name of the callback function as input and sets it as the thread spawn callback. The callback function will be invoked whenever new threads are spawned within the environment.

### Syntax

```rust
pub fn callback_thread<M: MemorySize>(
    ctx: FunctionEnvMut<'_, WasiEnv>,
    name: WasmPtr<u8, M>,
    name_len: M::Offset,
) -> Result<(), MemoryAccessError>
```

### Parameters

- `ctx`: The function environment.
- `name`: A pointer to a null-terminated string that represents the name of the callback function.
- `name_len`: The length of the name string.

### Return Value

The function returns `Result<(), MemoryAccessError>`. If the operation is successful, it returns `Ok(())`. Otherwise, it returns a `MemoryAccessError` indicating the reason for the failure.

### Logging

This function is instrumented with `debug` level logging. It includes the following fields for debugging purposes:

- `name`: The name of the thread spawn callback function.
- `funct_is_some`: Indicates whether the callback function is available (`Some`) or not (`None`).

### Note

- The `callback_thread()` function sets the callback function that will be invoked upon spawning of new threads.
- It retrieves the name string from the memory using the provided `name` pointer and `name_len`.
- The function then attempts to find the typed function with the specified name in the exports of the WebAssembly instance associated with the WASI environment. If the function is found, it sets it as the thread spawn callback.
- The callback function will be invoked whenever new threads are spawned within the WASI environment.
- To set the callback function, it updates the `thread_spawn` field in the inner data of the WASI environment.
- If the typed function with the specified name is not found in the exports of the WebAssembly instance, the callback is not set, and subsequent thread spawning events will not trigger the custom callback function.

By setting a custom thread spawn callback, applications can define their own logic to handle thread spawning events and perform specific actions when new threads are spawned. This allows for custom thread management and behavior within the WASI environment.
