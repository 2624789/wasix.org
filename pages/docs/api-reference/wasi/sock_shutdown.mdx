## `sock_shutdown()`

Shut down socket send and receive channels.

### Description

The `sock_shutdown()` function is used to shut down the send and receive channels of a socket. It is similar to the `shutdown` function in POSIX. The function allows you to selectively shut down either the send channel, the receive channel, or both channels of the socket.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `shutdown` in POSIX.
  ;;; Shut down socket send and receive channels.
  (@interface func (export "sock_shutdown")
    (param $fd $fd)
    ;;; Which channels on the socket to shut down.
    (param $how $sdflags)
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `sock`: The file descriptor of the socket to shut down.
- `how`: Specifies which channels on the socket to shut down.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value. If the operation is successful, `Errno::Success` is returned. Otherwise, an appropriate `Errno` value indicating the error is returned.

### Notes

- The `sock_shutdown()` function allows you to shut down the send and/or receive channels of a socket.
- The `how` parameter specifies which channels to shut down. It can take one of the following values:
  - `__WASI_SHUT_RD`: Shut down the receive channel.
  - `__WASI_SHUT_WR`: Shut down the send channel.
  - `__WASI_SHUT_RD | __WASI_SHUT_WR`: Shut down both the send and receive channels.
- The function maps the `how` value to the corresponding `std::net::Shutdown` enum variant and passes it to the underlying socket's `shutdown()` method.
- The specific behavior of the `sock_shutdown()` function may vary depending on the runtime environment and underlying networking implementation.
- This does not close the file descriptor, remember to `fd_close` afterwards
