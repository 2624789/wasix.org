## `path_link()`

Create a hard link.

### Description

The `path_link()` function creates a hard link between two files. It creates a new directory entry with the specified name in the destination directory, which refers to the same underlying file as the source file.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `link()` function. It creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file. The new link and the original file refer to the same inode and share the same content.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Note: This is similar to `linkat` in POSIX.
  ;;; Create a hard link.
  (@interface func (export "path_link")
    (param $old_fd $fd)
    ;;; Flags determining the method of how the path is resolved.
    (param $old_flags $lookupflags)
    ;;; The source path from which to link.
    (param $old_path string)
    ;;; The working directory at which the resolution of the new path starts.
    (param $new_fd $fd)
    ;;; The destination path at which to create the hard link.
    (param $new_path string)
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `old_fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory that the `old_path` is relative to.
- `old_flags`: Flags to control how the `old_path` is understood.
- `old_path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the old file path.
- `old_path_len`: The length of the `old_path` string.
- `new_fd`: The file descriptor representing the directory that the `new_path` is relative to.
- `new_path`: A wasm pointer to a null-terminated string containing the new file path.
- `new_path_len`: The length of the `new_path` string.

### Return Value

The function returns an `Errno` value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If the operation is successful, it returns `Errno::Success`. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate `Errno` value.

### Logging

This function has been instrumented with debug-level logging. It will log the following information:

- `%old_fd`: The file descriptor representing the source directory.
- `%new_fd`: The file descriptor representing the destination directory.
- `old_path`: The old file path.
- `new_path`: The new file path.

### Note

The `path_link()` function creates a hard link between two files. It checks if the necessary rights are present on both the source and target directories. It then creates a new directory entry in the target directory with the specified name, linking it to the source file.

On POSIX systems, a similar functionality is provided by the `link()` function.
