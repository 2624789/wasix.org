## `port_route_remove()`

Removes an existing route from the local port.

### Description

The `port_route_remove()` function removes an existing route from the routing table of the local port. This allows you to remove a route that is no longer needed or that needs to be updated.

### Syntax

```ebnf
  ;;; Removes an existing route from the local port
  (@interface func (export "port_route_remove")
    (param $cidr (@witx const_pointer $addr))
    (result $error (expected (error $errno)))
  )
```
### Parameters

- `ctx`: A mutable reference to the function environment.
- `ip`: A `WasmPtr` pointing to the memory location where the IP address of the route to be removed is stored.

### Return Value

The function returns a `Result` indicating the outcome of the operation. If the operation is successful, `Ok(Errno::Success)` is returned. If an error occurs, an appropriate `WasiError` is returned.

### Notes

- The `port_route_remove()` function removes an existing route from the routing table of the local port based on the specified IP address.
- The IP address of the route to be removed is provided through the `ip` parameter, which should point to a memory location that stores the IP address in the `__wasi_addr_t` format.
- The behavior and limitations of the `port_route_remove()` function may vary depending on the specific runtime environment and underlying networking implementation. It is important to consult the documentation or specifications of the specific environment to understand its behavior in that context.
