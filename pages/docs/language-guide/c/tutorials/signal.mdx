## Signals with WASIX

This sample project demonstrates how signals work with WASIX.

### Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk)
- [wasix-libc](https://github.com/wasix-org/wasix-libc)

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";
import { Callout, FileTree } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Start a new project

#### Create a new directory for your project:

```shell copy
$ mkdir wasix-signal
$ cd wasix-signal
```

#### Make a new file called signal.c:

```shell copy
$ touch signal.c
```

#### Link the SysRoot

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You need to link the SysRoot to your project. The SysRoot is a directory that
  contains the WASI libc headers and libraries. The SysRoot is located in the
  Wasix-libc binary or you can compile it yourself.
</Callout>

### Writing the Application

#### Basic Application Setup

We want to write a simple C program that demonstrates how to handle signals in a process. It should set up signal handlers for two signals: `SIGHUP` and `SIGINT`.

Let's write code for the above:

```c copy filename="signal.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

volatile int run = 1; // set to 0 when SIGINT is caught

/*
 * Signal handler function.
 * It is called when a signal is delivered to the process.
 */
void sig_handler(int signo)
{
    // SIGHUP is sent when user closes the terminal
    if (signo == SIGHUP)
    {
        run = 0; // set to 0 to terminate the program
        printf("received SIGHUP\n");
    }
    // SIGINT is sent when user presses Ctrl+C
    if (signo == SIGINT)
    {
        run = 0; // set to 0 to terminate the program
        printf("received SIGINT\n");
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    if (signal(SIGINT, sig_handler) == SIG_ERR)
        printf("\ncan't catch SIGINT\n");
    if (signal(SIGHUP, sig_handler) == SIG_ERR)
        printf("\ncan't catch SIGHUP\n");

    /*
     * Raise a SIGHUP signal.
     */
    raise(SIGHUP);

    // A long long wait so that we can easily issue a signal to this process
    while (run)
    {
        printf("running...\n");
        sleep(1); // sleep for 1 second
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The `main` function sets up the signal handlers using the `signal` function. It then raises a `SIGHUP` signal using the `raise` function. Finally, it enters a loop that prints "running..." every second until the `run` variable is set to 0 by one of the signal handlers.

#### Compiling the Application

Let's compile the application with `clang`:

```shell
$ clang -o signal signal.c
```

#### Running the Application

We can run the application with the following command:

```shell
$ ./signal
received SIGHUP
```

As we see the signal is received and the program terminates. But the signal is recieved so fast that we don't see the "running..." message.

#### Let's try to build this example with WASIX.

```shell
$ /path/to/wasix-sdk/clang signal.c --target="wasm32-wasi" -o signal.wasm
```

It's compiling! Now, let's try to run it:

```shell
$ wasmer run signal.wasm
received SIGHUP
```

It works!
