# Rust Wasix Usage

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="default" emoji="📦">
  Currenly, Wasix is only supported by the Wasmer runtime. So, you need to
  install the [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) runtime.
</Callout>

## `cargo wasix`

`cargo wasix` can be used to run, test, and build Rust programs for the Wasix

### Running a binary

```shell copy
$ cargo wasix run <path-to-wasm-file>
```

### Testing a binary

```shell copy
$ cargo wasix test <path-to-wasm-file>
```

### Building a binary

```shell copy
$ cargo wasix build <path-to-wasm-file>
```

### Benchmarking a binary

```shell copy
$ cargo wasix bench <path-to-wasm-file>
```

## `wasmer`

`wasmer-cli` can also be used to run `wasix` binaries. As well as provide additional flags such as `--enable-bulk-memory`, `--enable-threads` and `--net`.

### Additional flags

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Some wasm files need extra flags that can be provided while running the file
  with the runtime. For example, `wasmer run --enable-threads --net
  ./target/wasix/debug/hello.wasm`. Learn more about Wasmer's [runtime
  flags](https://docs.wasmer.io/ecosystem/wasmer/usage)

### Patched Repos

<Callout type="default" emoji="📦">
  Some crates require patches to work. We have assembled a list of patched repos
