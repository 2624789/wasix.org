## Threading with WASIX

This is a sample project that shows how to use features such as threading and sleep in WASIX.

### Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [WASIX](TODO: link to WASIX Installation with RUST)

import { Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";
import { Callout, FileTree } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Steps>

### Start a new project

```shell
$ cargo new --bin wasix-threading
     Created binary (application) `wasix-threading` package
```

Your `wasix-threading` directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="wasix-threading" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="main.rs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Your `Cargo.toml` should look like this:

```toml copy filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "wasix-threading"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

### Writing the Application

#### Basic Application Setup

We will write a basic threading example from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-01-threads.html).

Let's write code for the above:

```rust copy filename="src/main.rs"
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

Breakdown of main function:

- `thread::spawn` creates a new thread and returns a `JoinHandle` for it.
- `thread::sleep` is used to sleep the thread for a given duration.
- `handle.join()` waits for the thread to finish.

#### Running the Application

Run the application with the `cargo`:

```shell
$ cargo run
   Compiling wasix-threading v0.1.0 (/wasix-threading)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/wasix-threading`
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!
all done
```

#### Compiling with WASIX

Let's compile it with `wasix` now.

```shell
$ cargo wasix build
   Compiling wasix-threading v0.1.0 (/wasix-threading)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
info: Post-processing WebAssembly files
```

It builds! Now, let's try to run it:

```shell
$ cargo wasix run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `cargo-wasix target/wasm32-wasmer-wasi/debug/wasix-threading.wasm`
info: Post-processing WebAssembly files
     Running `target/wasm32-wasmer-wasi/debug/wasix-threading.wasm`
hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!
hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
hi number 6 from the spawned thread!
hi number 7 from the spawned thread!
hi number 8 from the spawned thread!
hi number 9 from the spawned thread!
```

Yay, it works! ðŸŽ‰

</Steps>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we saw that thread `spawn` and `sleep` work flawlessly in `wasix`.
